  Abstract                 = {Data centres containing high-performance computing (HPC) clusters may be able to coordinate with the operation of wind farms for mutual benefit. Large data centres consume megawatts of power, typically accounting for a majority of life cycle carbon emissions and a significant portion of the total cost of ownership. We ran simulations to explore the potential for data centres to adapt to dynamic electrical prices, variation in carbon intensity within an electrical grid, or the availability of local renewables. Using workloads from the Parallel Workloads Archive alongside real-world pricing data, we demonstrate potential savings on the cost of electricity ranging typically between 10-50\%. Adaptation to the variation in the electrical grid carbon intensity was not as successful, but adaptation to the availability of local renewables showed potential to significantly increase their use. In one example the fraction of power obtained from a local wind installation increased by 10-80\%.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues for "Free Lunch", a computation architecture that exploits otherwise wasted renewable energy by (i) colocating datacentres with these remote energy sources, (ii) connecting them over a dedicated network, and (iii) providing a software framework that supports the seamless execution and migration of virtual machines in the platform according to power availability. This work motivates and outlines the architecture and demonstrates its viability with a case study. Additionally, we discuss the major technical challenges facing the successful deployment of Free Lunch and the limiting factors inherent in its design.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose GreenSlot, a parallel batch job scheduler for a datacenter powered by a photovoltaic solar array and the electrical grid (as a backup). GreenSlot predicts the amount of solar energy that will be available in the near future, and schedules the workload to maximize the green energy consumption while meeting the jobs' deadlines. If grid energy must be used to avoid deadline violations, the scheduler selects times when it is cheap. Our results for production scientific workloads demonstrate that Green-Slot can increase green energy consumption by up to 117\% and decrease energy cost by up to 39\%, compared to a conventional scheduler. Based on these positive results, we conclude that green datacenters and green-energy-aware scheduling can have a significant role in building a more sustainable IT ecosystem.},

  Abstract                 = {Interest has been growing in powering datacenters (at least partially) with renewable or "green" sources of energy, such as solar or wind. However, it is challenging to use these sources because, unlike the "brown" (carbon-intensive) energy drawn from the electrical grid, they are not always available. This means that energy demand and supply must be matched, if we are to take full advantage of the green energy to minimize brown energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate how to manage a datacenter's computational workload to match the green energy supply. In particular, we consider data-processing frameworks, in which many background computations can be delayed by a bounded amount of time. We propose GreenHadoop, a MapReduce framework for a datacenter powered by a photovoltaic solar array and the electrical grid (as a backup). GreenHadoop predicts the amount of solar energy that will be available in the near future, and schedules the MapReduce jobs to maximize the green energy consumption within the jobs' time bounds. If brown energy must be used to avoid time bound violations, GreenHadoop selects times when brown energy is cheap, while also managing the cost of peak brown power consumption. Our experimental results demonstrate that GreenHadoop can significantly increase green energy consumption and decrease electricity cost, compared to Hadoop.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale computing systems such as data centers are facing increasing pressure to cap their carbon footprint. Integrating emerging clean energy solutions into computer system design therefore gains great significance in the green computing era. While some pioneering work on tracking variable power budget show promising energy efficiency, they are not suitable for data centers due to lack of performance guarantee when renewable generation is low and fluctuant. In addition, our characterization of wind power behavior reveals that data centers designed to track the intermittent renewable power incur up to 4X performance loss due to inefficient and redundant load matching activities. As a result, mitigating operational overhead while still maintaining desired energy utilization becomes the most significant challenge in managing server clusters on intermittent renewable energy generation. In this paper we take a first step in digging into the operational overhead of renewable energy powered data center. We propose iSwitch, a lightweight server power management that follows renewable power variation characteristics, leverages existing system infrastructures, and applies supply/load cooperative scheme to mitigate the performance overhead. Comparing with state-of-the-art renewable energy driven system design, iSwitch could mitigate average network traffic by 75\%, peak network traffic by 95\%, and reduce 80\% job waiting time while still maintaining 96\% renewable energy utilization. We expect that our work can help computer architects make informed decisions on sustainable and high-performance system design.},

  Abstract                 = {Demand response is a crucial aspect of the future smart grid. It has the potential to provide significant peak demand reduction and to ease the incorporation of renewable energy into the grid. Data centers' participation in demand response is becoming increasingly important given the high and increasing energy consumption and the flexibility in demand management in data centers compared to conventional industrial facilities. In this extended abstract we briefly describe recent work in our full paper on two demand response schemes to reduce a data center's peak loads and energy expenditure: workload shifting and the use of local power generations. In our full paper, we conduct a detailed characterization study of coincident peak data over two decades from Fort Collins Utilities, Colorado and then develop two algorithms for data centers by combining workload scheduling and local power generation to avoid the coincident peak and reduce the energy expenditure. The first algorithm optimizes the expected cost and the second one provides a good worst-case guarantee for any coincident peak pattern. We evaluate these algorithms via numerical simulations based on real world traces from production systems. The results show that using workload shifting in combination with local generation can provide significant cost savings (up to 40\% in the Fort Collins Utilities' case) compared to either alone.},

In this paper we propose a job power aware scheduling mechanism to reduce HPC's electricity bill without degrading the system utilization. The novelty of our job scheduling mechanism is its ability to take the variation of electricity price into consideration as a means to make better decisions of the timing of scheduling jobs with diverse power profiles. We verified the effectiveness of our design by conducting trace-based experiments on an IBM Blue Gene/P and a cluster system as well as a case study on Argonne's 48-rack IBM Blue Gene/Q system. Our preliminary results show that our power aware algorithm can reduce electricity bill of HPC systems as much as 23\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy expense is becoming increasingly dominant in the operating costs of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. At the same time, electricity prices vary significantly at different times of the day. Furthermore, job power profiles also differ greatly, especially on HPC systems. In this paper, we propose a smart, power-aware job scheduling approach for HPC systems based on variable energy prices and job pow- er profiles. In particular, we propose a 0-1 knapsack model and demon- strate its flexibility and effectiveness for scheduling jobs, with the goal of reducing energy cost and not degrading system utilization. We design scheduling strategies for Blue Gene/P, a typical partition-based system. Experiments with both synthetic data and real job traces from produc- tion systems show that our power-aware job scheduling approach can reduce the energy cost significantly, up to 25\%, with only slight impact on system utilization.},
